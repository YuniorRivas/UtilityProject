        <h2>Understanding Your Rights During Protests</h2>
        <p>In recent weeks, college campuses across New York City, including the City College of New York (CUNY), have seen a significant wave of student protests. These protests primarily call for pro-Palestinian solidarity and institutional divestment from Israel. The protests, which began in mid-April 2024, have involved encampments and marches, leading to clashes with the New York Police Department (NYPD) and over 170 arrests at City College alone. The confrontations in many of these protests highlight the importance of knowing your rights and learning how to interact with law enforcement.</p>
        
        <h3>Know Your Rights</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Right to Peaceful Assembly:</strong> You have the right to peacefully assemble and protest. However, you must comply with lawful orders from police officers, such as dispersal commands, to avoid charges like disorderly conduct.</li>
            <li><strong>Showing Identification:</strong> You are not required to show ID while protesting, unless you are being lawfully detained or arrested. If asked for ID, you can inquire if you are being detained.</li>
            <li><strong>Recording the Police:</strong> You have the right to record police activities in public spaces, as long as you do not interfere with their operations.</li>
            <li><strong>During an Arrest:</strong> If arrested, stay calm, remain silent, and immediately ask for a lawyer. Do not resist arrest, as this can lead to additional charges.</li>
        </ul>
