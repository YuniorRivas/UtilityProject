            question: "You're attending a peaceful protest in NYC and a police officer orders the crowd to disperse, even though you're not blocking traffic or being violent. What should you do?",
            answers: [
                { text: "Refuse to move and sit down", correct: false, explanation: "Refusing to move might lead to arrest for disobedience of a lawful order." },
                { text: "Continue protesting as usual", correct: false, explanation: "Continuing to protest can result in similar consequences as ignoring a dispersal order." },
                { text: "Disperse as instructed", correct: true, explanation: "Following police orders to disperse can prevent charges such as disorderly conduct or failure to obey a lawful order." },
                { text: "Start chanting louder", correct: false, explanation: "Increasing the volume of chants after a dispersal order can be seen as escalating the situation, possibly leading to enhanced charges." }
            ]
        },
        {
            question: "While protesting, you see a police officer recording the crowd. What is your best course of action?",
            answers: [
                { text: "Demand the officer stops recording", correct: false, explanation: "Demanding that an officer stops recording is ineffective as police have the legal right to record in public settings for monitoring and evidence." },
                { text: "Cover your face and continue protesting", correct: true, explanation: "Covering your face and continuing to protest respects lawful monitoring while protecting your identity, minimizing personal risk." },
                { text: "Try to grab the camera", correct: false, explanation: "Attempting to grab the camera can lead to charges such as obstructing governmental administration or even assault." },
                { text: "Tell others to stop protesting", correct: false, explanation: "Telling others to stop protesting can diminish the effectiveness of the protest and spread unnecessary fear." }
            ]
        },
        {
            question: "The police have set up barriers at a protest you're attending. You want to cross the barrier to join the other group of protesters. What should you do?",
            answers: [
                { text: "Cross the barrier anyway", correct: false, explanation: "Crossing the barrier directly violates police orders and can result in arrest for trespassing or disorderly conduct." },
                { text: "Look for an alternative route that does not involve crossing the barrier", correct: true, explanation: "Looking for an alternative route that does not involve crossing the barrier respects the law enforcement boundaries and avoids confrontation." },
                { text: "Dismantle the barrier yourself", correct: false, explanation: "Dismantling the barrier is a direct violation of property laws and likely to result in charges of vandalism or destruction of property." },
                { text: "Encourage others to push through the barrier", correct: false, explanation: "Encouraging others to push through can lead to charges of inciting a riot or disorderly conduct." }

            question: "You're at a protest and a police officer asks for your identification. What are your rights?",
            answers: [
                { text: "You must provide it immediately", correct: false, explanation: "Providing ID immediately isn't required unless you're under arrest or in specific situations like driving." },
                { text: "You can refuse if you're not being lawfully detained or arrested", correct: true, explanation: "You can refuse if you're not being lawfully detained or arrested. This respects your Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures." },
                { text: "Run away from the officer", correct: false, explanation: "Running away from the officer can lead to charges such as resisting arrest or evading police." },
                { text: "You must show it only if you are inside a vehicle", correct: false, explanation: "The requirement to show ID only in a vehicle applies specifically to traffic stops and not to general protests." }

        {
            question: "During a protest, a police officer tells you that using a megaphone is illegal. What should you do?",
            answers: [
                { text: "Use the megaphone louder to challenge the claim", correct: false, explanation: "Using the megaphone louder can lead to arrest for disorderly conduct if it's indeed illegal." },
                { text: "Stop using the megaphone and check the local ordinances later", correct: true, explanation: "Ceasing megaphone use and checking the local ordinances later complies temporarily and avoids potential charges for violating noise ordinances or similar regulations." },
                { text: "Hand the megaphone to another protester", correct: false, explanation: "Handing the megaphone to another protester doesn't address the legal issue and could contribute to their risk." },
                { text: "Argue with the officer about your rights", correct: false, explanation: "Arguing about rights on the spot is unlikely to change the officer's enforcement at that moment and may escalate the situation." }
            ]
        },
        {
            question: "You're at a protest and witness an arrest taking place. What's the best way to respond?",
            answers: [
                { text: "Attempt to intervene physically", correct: false, explanation: "Physically intervening can lead to arrest for obstructing justice or assault." },
                { text: "Start shouting at the police officer", correct: false, explanation: "Shouting at the officer can escalate the situation, potentially leading to additional charges." },
                { text: "Document the arrest from a safe distance", correct: true, explanation: "Documenting the arrest from a safe distance is legally protected and helps ensure that any potential misconduct is recorded without interfering." },
                { text: "Ignore the arrest and continue protesting", correct: false, explanation: "Ignoring the arrest misses an opportunity to document potential abuses of power." }

            question: "A protest you are attending starts to get chaotic, and tear gas is deployed. What is the safest action to take?",
            answers: [
                { text: "Run towards the police lines", correct: false, explanation: "Running towards police lines can be seen as an act of aggression and lead to forceful retaliation." },
                { text: "Stay put and hold your ground", correct: false, explanation: "Staying put risks severe health effects from tear gas." },
                { text: "Try to throw the tear gas canisters back", correct: false, explanation: "Throwing tear gas canisters back can result in serious charges such as assault on a police officer or rioting." },
                { text: "Move away from the area where the gas was deployed and find a safe route to leave", correct: true, explanation: "Moving away from the area where the gas was deployed and finding a safe route to leave is the safest response to avoid harm." }

            question: "You want to bring a sign to a protest in NYC. Which material should you use for the sign's handle?",
            answers: [
                { text: "Cardboard tubing", correct: true, explanation: "Using a less rigid material avoids violating protest rules regarding potential weapons." },
                { text: "A thin wooden stick", correct: false, explanation: "A thin wooden stick can be considered a weapon by law enforcement." },
                { text: "Plastic piping", correct: false, explanation: "Plastic piping might also be viewed as a potential weapon." },
                { text: "A retractable selfie stick", correct: false, explanation: "A retractable selfie stick can be seen as a weapon and might be banned in some protest scenarios." }

            question: "At a protest, you feel that the NYPD is infringing on your right to free speech. What should you do?",
            answers: [
                { text: "Start a chant against the NYPD", correct: false, explanation: "Starting a chant against the NYPD could escalate tensions and doesn't address the specific issue of rights infringement." },
                { text: "File a formal complaint after the protest", correct: true, explanation: "Filing a formal complaint after the protest is a proper and legally sound method to address perceived rights violations, offering a record and potential investigation without immediate confrontation." },
                { text: "Confront the officers about it directly", correct: false, explanation: "Confronting the officers directly about rights infringement on the spot can escalate the situation and might not lead to a constructive resolution." },
                { text: "Encourage others to act against the police", correct: false, explanation: "Encouraging others to act against the police can be construed as inciting a riot or disorderly conduct, potentially leading to criminal charges." }

            question: "If you're arrested during a protest, what is the first thing you should do?",
            answers: [
                { text: "Resist the arrest to show your disagreement", correct: false, explanation: "Resisting arrest could lead to additional charges such as obstruction of justice or assault on a police officer." },
                { text: "Ask for a lawyer and remain silent", correct: true, explanation: "Asking for a lawyer and remaining silent is your right under the Fifth Amendment, which protects against self-incrimination, and the Sixth Amendment, which ensures the right to legal representation. This action minimizes the risk of inadvertently providing information that could be used against you in court." },
                { text: "Tell the police everything to clear the misunderstanding", correct: false, explanation: "Explaining your actions without a lawyer present can inadvertently lead to self-incrimination." },
